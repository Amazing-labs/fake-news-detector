> A collaborative fact-checking platform that empowers citizens and journalists to combat misinformation through a structured, transparent verification process.

## Overview

Fake News Detector is a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** based platform that facilitates collaborative fact-checking. The system connects three distinct user roles in a structured workflow to verify information accuracy and publish transparent analysis results.

### Business Vision

In an era of information overload, distinguishing fact from fiction is critical. This platform creates an ecosystem where:
- **Citizens** contribute by reporting suspicious content and providing evidence
- **Journalists** conduct thorough investigations using professional methodology
- **Directors** ensure quality control and editorial standards

## Key Features

### Multi-Role Collaboration
- **Citizen (REGULAR)** - Submit reports (max 3 open), track status, view notifications, apply for Watcher status
- **Citizen (WATCHER)** - Privileged citizens who can submit evidence to ongoing investigations (+2 engagement points)
- **Journalist** - Pick reports, conduct investigations (max 1 active), submit for review
- **Director (EDITORIAL_DIRECTOR)** - Validate investigations, publish/archive results, manage users, approve Watcher applications

### Structured Fact-Checking Workflow
```
Report ──▶ InboxSubject ──▶ Investigation ──▶ Review ──▶ Publication
              (mandatory)        (origin-tagged media)
```

1. **Submission** - Citizens submit suspicious content with media (Report status: OPEN)
2. **Inbox Creation** - All reports become InboxSubjects (origin: REPORT or DIRECTOR_INITIATED)
3. **Assignment** - Journalists pick InboxSubjects and start investigations
4. **Evidence Collection** - Watchers contribute supporting evidence
5. **Validation** - Directors review and approve investigations
6. **Publication** - Verified analysis is published with final verdict

### Quality Control Mechanisms
- **Citizen Report Limit** - Maximum 3 open reports per citizen (`MAX_REPORTING_PER_CITIZEN_AT_A_TIME = 3`)
- **Journalist Investigation Limit** - Maximum 1 active investigation per journalist (`MAX_INVESTIGATIONS_PER_JOURNALIST_AT_A_TIME = 1`)
- **Evidence Submission Restriction** - Only citizens with `WATCHER` type can submit evidence
- **Watcher Promotion System** - Citizens apply via `WatcherApplication`; Director approves/rejects
- **Revision Attempt Limits** - Maximum attempts for correction cycles (`MAX_REVISION_ATTEMPTS`, `MAX_CORRECTION_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Media Origin Tracking** - All media tracked by origin: `CITIZEN_REPORT`, `DIRECTOR_INITIATED`, `JOURNALIST_PROOF`
- **Source Media Classification** - Citizen/Director media require category, reliability, justification by journalist
- **Journalist Proof Requirements** - Journalist-added media require authority source, no classification fields
- **Watcher Evidence Media** - Watcher contributions require at least one media with complete classification
- **Engagement Scoring** - Points awarded for participation (submit report: +1, submit evidence: +2, publication: +2)
- **Account Status Management** - ACTIVE, DISABLED, BANNED states with reasons (SPAM, ABUSE, FRAUD, INACTIVITY, USER_REQUEST, OTHER)

## Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The application follows DDD principles with clear bounded contexts:

```
src/
├── domain/              # Business logic and entities
│   ├── entities/        # Core domain objects
│   ├── value-objects/   # Immutable value types (Media, VerifiedMedia, etc.)
│   ├── factories/       # Entity factories
│   ├── repositories/    # Repository interfaces
│   ├── services/        # Domain services
│   └── processes/       # Complex business processes (workflow orchestration)
├── application/      # Use cases and application services
├── infrastructure/   # Technical implementations
│   ├── config/       # Database, Prisma
│   └── persistence/  # Repositories
└── interfaces/       # API controllers, DTOs
```

### Core Entities

| Entity | Responsibility | Key Invariants |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `Citizen` | Report submission, watcher application, evidence submission (if WATCHER) | Max 3 open reports; Only WATCHER can submit evidence |
| `Journalist` | Investigation management, draft creation, submission for review | Max 1 active investigation at a time |
| `Director` | Validation, user management, inbox subject creation, watcher approval | Cannot validate own work; Editorial oversight |
| `Report` | User-submitted suspicious content with theme, title, content | Simple lifecycle: OPEN → ARCHIVED only |
| `Investigation` | Journalist's fact-checking process with verdict and media category | Max revision attempts; Requires media category before submission |
| `Evidence` | Supporting documents submitted by Watchers | Linked to investigation; Submitter must be WATCHER |
| `Publication` | Final approved analysis with verdict | Can be marked as correction |
| `WatcherApplication` | Request for citizen to become WATCHER | Status: PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED |
| `Notification` | System alerts for users | Types: PUBLICATION, CORRECTION, ALERT, ARCHIVED_PUBLICATION. Targeted notifications for archived investigations |
| `InboxSubject` | Topics created by Directors for organization | Managed by Directors only; Origin: REPORT or DIRECTOR_INITIATED |

### Investigation Lifecycle

```
OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → PENDING_REVIEW → [PUBLISHED | ARCHIVED | NEEDS_REVISION → IN_PROGRESS]
```

**Status Definitions:**
- **OPEN** - Initial state when journalist picks a report
- **IN_PROGRESS** - Journalist working on draft (can edit media category, verdict, notes)
- **PENDING_REVIEW** - Submitted to Director for validation
- **NEEDS_REVISION** - Director rejected; sent back for corrections
- **PUBLISHED** - Director approved; investigation is public
- **ARCHIVED** - Investigation with UNVERIFIABLE verdict (cannot be verified)

**Source of Truth Principle:**
- **Report**: Tracks citizen submission only (`OPEN → ARCHIVED`)
- **InboxSubject**: Tracks investigation progress (`OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → ARCHIVED`)
- **Investigation**: Tracks fact-checking workflow

**Transitions:**
- Journalist: `OPEN` → `PENDING_REVIEW` (via `submitForReview()`)
- Director: `PENDING_REVIEW` → `PUBLISHED` (if verdict is TRUE/FALSE/MISLEADING)
- Director: `PENDING_REVIEW` → `ARCHIVED` (if verdict is UNVERIFIABLE)
- Director: `PENDING_REVIEW` → `NEEDS_REVISION` (rejection with feedback)
- Journalist: `NEEDS_REVISION` → `OPEN` (correction cycle)

### Domain Values

**Media Categories** (Classification of suspicious content):
- `CONTEXT_COLLAPSE` - Missing or altered context
- `MANIPULATED` - Edited or doctored content
- `FABRICATED` - Completely false/original creation
- `SATIRE` - Parody or satirical content presented as fact
- `MISLEADING` - Partially true but misleading presentation
- `IMPOSTOR` - Impersonation or false attribution
- `OTHER` - Does not fit other categories

**Verdicts** (Final determination):
- `TRUE` - Content is accurate
- `FALSE` - Content is completely false
- `MISLEADING` - Content is partially true but misleading
- `UNVERIFIABLE` - Cannot be verified (leads to ARCHIVED status)

**Standard Publication Verdicts**: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `MISLEADING` (can be published)
**Archive-only Verdict**: `UNVERIFIABLE` (must be archived, not published)

**Notification Types**:
- `PUBLICATION` - New publication available (broadcast to all citizens)
- `CORRECTION` - Published content corrected
- `ALERT` - System or administrative alert
- `ARCHIVED_PUBLICATION` - Investigation archived with UNVERIFIABLE verdict (targeted: journalist + citizen + watchers only)

**Notification Behavior**:
- **Publications** (TRUE/FALSE/MISLEADING verdicts): Broadcast to all citizens + journalist notification
- **Archived Publications** (UNVERIFIABLE verdicts): Targeted notifications only to stakeholders (journalist who investigated, citizen who reported, watchers who contributed evidence)
